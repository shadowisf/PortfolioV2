      bell hospital is a <u>cli-based hospital management system</u> built with
      java to streamline healthcare administration. the system combines oop
      principles with practical file-based persistence to manage:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>core entities</b>: patient/doctor records, appointment scheduling
          (linking entities), and medicine inventory (tracking dosage/expiry).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>oop implementation</b>: encapsulation via self-contained classes
          (patient, doctor, etc.), reusable modules for file i/o and search
          operations, and abstraction through methods like
          getappointmentdoctorid()
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>data persistence</b>: uses objectoutputstream/objectinputstream to
          save encrypted .txt files, maintaining data between sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>file-based crud</b>: full create/read/update/delete operations with
          serialized storage
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>advanced search</b>: multi-filter queries (date ranges, id lookups,
          medicine expiry)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>error resilience</b>: input validation and graceful exception
          handling
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>modular architecture</b>: designed for future expansion
          (billing/lab modules)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>

      bell hospital is a solo project where i:
      <ul>
        <li>
          designed class structures mirroring real-world relationships
          (patientâ†”appointment)
        </li>
        <li>
          implemented file operations using java i/o streams for data
          persistence
        </li>
        <li>built search algorithms for appointments and inventory</li>
        <li>wrote documented, maintainable code with robust error handling</li>
        <li>created user-friendly console prompts and menus</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      this project solidified my java oop skills while solving practical data
      management challenges in a clinical context.
