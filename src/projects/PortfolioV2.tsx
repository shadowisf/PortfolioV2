      portfolio v2 is a <u>complete redesign of my original portfolio</u>,
      moving beyond the cartoonish minimalism of v1 into a more refined,
      performance-focused experience. while keeping the core content (projects,
      bio, research), this iteration prioritizes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>optimized performance</b>: removed bulky libraries and streamlined
          assets for faster loading.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>enhanced animations</b>: replaced css animations with gsap for
          smoother, more controlled motion design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>cleaner aesthetics</b>: balanced visual hierarchy and whitespace
          for better readability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>performance focus</b>: lazy loading, image optimization, dependency
          optimization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>scalable architecture</b>: modular components with typescript
          interfaces.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>

      portfolio v2 is a <u>solo project</u> where i:
      <ul>
        <li>
          audited v1â€™s pain points and iterated on layout, color, and motion.
        </li>
        <li>crafted gsap sequences (e.g., mobile transitions).</li>
        <li>migrated from css to scss modules, trimmed unused dependencies.</li>
        <li>ported all v1 content while improving its presentation.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      this project demonstrates my growth in creating polished, high-performance
      frontend experiences while maintaining content integrity.
